## Matrix Keyboard

My first version of the CHIP8 emulator had the matrix keyboard
connected directly to the ARVduino. But to get the higher 
video resolution, I need more pins. So I decided to move the 
keyboard to the data bus.

I use an AVR128DB28 to scan the matrix keyboard. If a key is 
pressed, it checks the ACK line to see if any other peripheral
is being serviced. If ACK is low, it then waits for the H_sync
to go high then low again thus starting at the begining of the
pixel clock. It then triggers an interrupt and waits for the
ACK line to go high. It then sets it's data port as output and
places the key value on the data bus. Once the ACK line goes
low, it sets it's data bus to input and returns to scaning the
keys.

Here is a schematic showing the keyboard connections to the
AVR128DB28.

The keyboard only uses 5 data lines. 0 to 3 hold the key 
number, 0x00 to 0x0F, and the 4th is either 0 for key off 
or 1 for key on.

After a little work with the logic on the receive side, I 
got it to pass the [Timendus](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite?tab=readme-ov-file) keyboard test.
