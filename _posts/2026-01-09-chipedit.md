## CHIP8 Editor

Tool a little break on the emulator and coded up an
editor..

I have prorammed in TCL/TK but it has been many years, so
I worked with Google AI and then coustomized a few things.
It has a main text area where you can enter CHIP8 opcodes,
comment lines and labels. There is a scratch area to hold
working information. There is both a project save, which 
saves everthing in the center window and a HEX dump which
saves the opcodes only in a 0x##, 0x##, format for entering
in a byte array. There is a serial monitor for debug and a 
download the hex to the AVR128DB48. There is a jump to address
function and a help menu with all the CHIP8 opcodes.
Should make programming the emulator a lot eaiser.
